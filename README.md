Here's an improved version of the `README.md` file for your algorithm study repository:

# Algorithm Study - Java

This repository contains Java solutions to a variety of algorithmic problems, primarily sourced from [Baekjoon Online Judge (BOJ)](https://www.acmicpc.net/). Each solution is organized by problem ID, making it easy to reference specific challenges.

## Profile

You can view my problem-solving progress on BOJ at [my solved.ac profile](https://solved.ac/profile/majesty1970).

## Language

- **Language Used**: Java

## Folder Structure

- **`src/`**: This directory contains all the source code files for the algorithm problems.
    - Each subfolder is named using the problem's ID code, which corresponds to the specific problem on the BOJ website.

### Example:
- **1260 DFS BFS**: Implements Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms for graph traversal.
- **1697 Catch that Cow**: Solves a shortest path problem, typically using BFS.
- **1764 듣보잡**: Involves set operations or hashing to find common elements between two lists.
- ...and so on.

**Note**: These source codes are designed to be executed within the BOJ platform, and may not be directly executable outside of that environment without modification.


### Backtracking
   15650

### DP
9252
## How to Use

To use these codes:

1. **BOJ Platform**:
    - Copy and paste the code directly into the BOJ submission page for the respective problem.
    - Make sure to handle input/output as required by the problem statement.

2. **Local Environment**:
    - To run these codes locally, you will need to simulate the input that would be provided on the BOJ platform.
    - Compile the `.java` file using `javac` and run it using `java` with the appropriate input redirection or manual input during execution.
